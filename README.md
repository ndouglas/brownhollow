# Brownhollow
Artificial life, social/factional/economic simulation and procedural content generation and tools.

The general hope here is that I can generate something like a goblin village and its environs (probably leaning on [Breakwater](https://github.com/ndouglas/breakwater/) for the latter part), run it for forty years, and provide the player with the resulting situation.
